Corporate Overview

Ally Financial was originally created as GMAC in 1919.  Headquartered in Detroit, MI, GMAC was an acronym for General Motors Acceptance Corporation, given to it by its parent, General Motors.[^Wiki]  GMAC was created to provide capital liquidity to automobile dealerships for their inventory.  As consumer demand grew for automobiles, GMAC expanded its offering to provide purchase financing to customers at the auto dealerships.
In an effort to diversify its business lines over the years, GMAC created subsidiaries, including:

* L1 – GMAC Real Estate
* L1 – GMAC Bank
* L1 – GMAC ResCap

In 2006, General Motors sold its controlling interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management.  The financial crisis of 2007-2008 had a negative impact on GMAC.  They received $16.2B in government funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  A few years later, in 2010, GMAC was approved to become a bank holding company as part of their re-building plans.  Later that same year, GMAC was re-branded as Ally Financial.  In 2014, Ally became a publicly traded company.  At the same time, it fully repaid the government the remaining TARP funds received previously.

Ally Financial has continued to maintain a diversified portfolio of income streams.  Included within this financial entity are the following groups:[Ally 2019 Financials](https://www.ally.com/files/sections/investor/pdf/2019-10k.pdf)
* L1 - Ally Auto:  independent financier for automobile dealerships
* L1 - Ally Bank:  online bank
* L1 - Ally Home:  home mortgage originations platform.  Formed a partnership with Better.com (aka Better Mortgage Corporation) [housingwire](  https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48828-ally-financial-partnering-with-bettercom-to-launch-digital-mortgage-platform/)
* L1 - Ally Invest:  online brokerage unit providing self-directed accounts and investment advisory services
* L1 - Ally Lending (resulting entity re-named after the acquisition of Health Credit Services):  a point-of-sale healthcare lender offering options for consumers to pay for products and services not covered by insurance
* L1 - Ally Ventures:  strategic investment group
* L1 - CardWorks (announced in Feb. 2020): non-prime credit card provider and consumer finance lender [prnewswire]( https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ally-financial-announces-agreement-to-acquire-cardworks-301007099.html)
Ally celebrated their 100th year in business in 2019.  They earned $6.3B in total net revenue and net income of $1.7B.  Ally’s market capitalization at the end of 2019 was just over $6 billion ($6.163B). [^Yahoo! Finance 04/30/20]  As could be expected, Ally’s primary lines of business are Dealer Financial Services (includes both automotive finance and insurance services), Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance.  Their corporate mission centers around the phrase “Do it Right”, another reminder for a company trying to reinvent itself after the financial crisis.

Ally is facing a couple of primary concerns related to the fintech industry:
* L1 – Privacy concern:  as a digital company, evidenced by the fact that they have no brick and mortar bank branches, Ally’s top concern is data security.  A breach in customer data would represent a huge blow to their ability to be trusted with personal information and significantly damage their market reputation.
* L1 – Regulatory:  Ally has regulatory requirements and restrictions governed by multiple agencies, partly due to their status as a bank holding company.  Consequently, in some cases, they are limited in procedures and products offerings as compared to some of their competitors.  These regulations also enforce capital requirements that could hinder their ability to allocate funds as desired to remain on the cutting edge of technology in their industry.

At this time, Ally should have a financial product applicable to any person old enough to drive an automobile.  The product offering expands as these customers increase in age, income and financial or social responsibilities.  With just under 330 million people in the United States [^Census.gov], even if we were to exclude 40% of the population for various reasons, there are still almost 200 million potential customers for Ally to solicit and convert into lifelong customers.

Ally’s competitive advantage lies in the fact that they have a lot of capital as a result of their IPO and their bank holding company.  This has allowed them to investment in technology, both internally and through external partnerships such as Better.com, to stay up with the latest advances in security and customer interaction/experience.  This robust funding is not a given resource for start-ups trying to establish themselves as a force in this relatively new industry.

Ally’s customer contact is dependent upon their technological platforms.  Their customer touchpoints must be fast, secure, and, possibly most important to the customer on a daily basis, easy to use and understand.  Ally is using machine learning, AI, virtual reality and augmented reality solutions to combat fraud and improve customer experience.  In addition, with their new hire at CIO, Sathish Muthukrishnan, I would expect them to increase their investment and research in blockchain, as that domain was part of his previous work experience.

Ally’s primary business lines are dealer financial services, which includes dealer finance and automotive insurance, mortgage finance and corporate finance.  Consequently, Ally’s fintech domain would be lending, both business to business, as well as business to consumer.  Some major players in the non-banking market would include the following:
* L1 – Toyota Motor Credit Corporation
* L1 – Ford Motor Credit Company
* L1 – Daimler Financial Services
* L1 – GM Financial Inc.

This market has seen an increase in innovation and competition over the past decade.  Gone are the days of relying only on a local bank or credit union to provide financing.  Online entrants offering various financing options have saturated the market.  Borrowers can obtain pre-approval packages from direct lenders before ever contacting a dealership or stepping on the lot.  Platforms built on predictive analytics have ushered in a new reality whereby customers can select vehicles and financing packages at their convenience, compared to days past.

Ally’s impact in fintech has not be game-changing, but also, it has not gone without notice.  Ally has purchased three companies in the past 5 years that have added to its digital presence in multiple markets.  The acquisition of TradeKing resulted in Ally’s online investment arm, Ally Invest.  Ally continues to seek to improve these customer experiences through their various digital portals while safeguarding their customer’s private data.

In banking, a common performance metric is net interest margin.  This metric monitors the profit a company derives from its interest-earning assets.  In addition, Ally has been committed to tracking their earnings-per-share since their IPO in 2014.  For a company that has experienced government bailout and financial crisis back in 2008, it can be understood why they want to keep a close eye on earnings, not only for themselves, but as an assurance to shareholders that they are continuing to guide this new company in the right direction.

Below are Ally’s performance numbers over the past 2 years:
* L1 - Net interest margin – 0.95% (2019), 0.74% (2018)
* L1 - Adjusted earnings per share - $3.72 (2019), $3.34 (2018)

In both cases, the numbers are trending upward, supporting their corporate efforts for financial soundness.  As previously mentioned, Ally’s financial position provides them a competitive advantage in the market for innovation and investment.

For some contrast, Toyota Motor Credit Corp.’s net interest margins were (-.562) in 2019 and (-.288) in 2018. [^HFW]  Ford Motor Company’s adjusted EPS was $0.12 in 2019 and $0.30 in 2018.

I don’t believe Ally needs to introduce a new product at this time.  Ally currently owns access to a typical consumer’s entire financial needs package:  automobile financing and insurance, home financing, personal investing, healthcare coverage and credit cards/consumer debt.  Ally’s concern should be the seamless integration of these various businesses to optimize their ability to leverage these resources and the consumer data available.  The result should be the ability to combine various financial offerings in an internal marketplace available to customers at a more efficient and less expensive level compared to competing offers.  That would increase Ally’s probability of capturing a larger share of the “new/millennial” banking market and making the costs to leave prohibitive for existing customers.  They should be able to measure these results in profits and customer loyalty, while creating customers for life.

Two technologies come to mind supporting this next evolution within Ally.  First would be blockchain as an additional security measure.  Passing customer data across business lines will increase the potential for a data leak or breach.  Maximizing the security features of blockchain could help to minimize the security concerns.  As mentioned previously, the new CIO has a history in using blockchain.  The second technology would be Slack, or another communication platform.  Sharing customer information efficiently is critical.  Instead of working on an inanimate project, staff are working on a customer’s financial life.  Similar to an assembly line process, knowing when to add the correct financial offering – auto insurance for a new driver, health care financing for new parents, investment advice for 35+ year old workers, makes the difference between creating a customer for life, or losing a customer for good.
